<span class="project-logo">
[![GNU Emacs](/media/images/projects/emacs.png GNU Emacs)](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
</span>

I've been using [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for a couple
of years, back around 2000. But I never dived into it, and then switched to
[vim](http://www.vim.org). But recently, I started using it again, and I
liked it a lot. So much that in the first year using it, I've started
contributing to it, writing patches in various area of its code base, and
joining sub-projects.

## Org-mode

<time>Since 2011</time>

<span class="project-logo">
[![Org-mode](/media/images/projects/org-mode.png Org-mode)](http://orgmode.org)
</span>

I developed actively some parts of [Org-mode](http://www.orgmode.org), the
organization mode for Emacs. My work was focused mainly on the agenda and
contacts management.

## el-get

<time>Since 2010</time>

[el-get](http://github.com/dimitri/el-get) allows you to install and manage
elisp code for Emacs. It supports lots of differents types of sources and is
able to install them, update them and remove them.

I've joined my friend Dimitri on this project and helps him to make it better!

## Gnus

<span class="project-logo">
[![Gnus](/media/images/projects/gnus.png Gnus)](http://gnus.org)
</span>

In February 2010, I've started to use [Gnus](http://gnus.org) to read my
e-mails in [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I started hacking
it on various area, and then joined the project.

# Freedesktop

<time>Since 2008</time>

<span class="project-logo">
[![Freedesktop](/media/images/projects/freedesktop.png Freedesktop)](http://freedesktop.org)
</span>

In June 2008, while developing [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org), I've
started to contribute to various projects on
[Freedesktop](http://freedesktop.org). Some components used in *awesome* had
to be improved, so I joined some developement team like the
[XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org) one. I've also worked on
[startup-notification](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/startup-notification)
port to XCB.

## XCB

<time>Since 2008</time>

<span class="project-logo">
[![XCB](/media/images/projects/xcb.png XCB)](http://xcb.freedesktop.org)
</span>

The X protocol C-language Binding ([XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org)) is a replacement for Xlib featuring
a small footprint, latency hiding, direct access to the protocol, improved
threading support, and extensibility.

I contributed to it while developing awesome, because the version 3 is
entirely based on XCB, and dropped Xlib support. At that time, awesome was
one of the first project to use XCB, so we had to fix some issues in it, and
improve the helper libraries.

# awesome

<time>Since 2007</time>

<span class="project-logo">
[![awesome](/media/images/projects/awesome.png awesome)](http://awesome.naquadah.org)
</span>

In August 2007, I've started to work on
[awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org), a window manager. It's basically a
frame-work where you can use and create your own UI paradigm. The default UI
implementation comes with windows tiling support, message notification,
various widgets, and many more things.

# Debian

<time>Since 2002</time>

<span class="project-logo">
[![Debian](/media/images/projects/debian.png Debian)](http://www.debian.org)
</span>

Since April 2002, I am an
[official Debian developer](http://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=acid@hno3.org),
and I maintain
[several packages](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=acid).

Between 2003 and 2008,
I've worked on [apt-build](http://packages.debian.org/apt-build), a tool to
rebuild Debian packages the way you want ([GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) flags and optimizations
choice, configure options, etc).

I am also a former member of the
[Xen maintainers team](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-xen/) which I
started around 2006. I also did some quality assurance (QA) work (rebuilding
the full archive is an example with [rebuildd](/software/rebuildd)) and also
participated in bug squashing parties. In 2006, I also worked as a Stable
Release Manager.

Since 2011, I'm a co-founder and active member of the
[OpenStack packagers team](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/openstack/).

[TuxFamily](http://www.tuxfamily.org) is a non-profit organization aiming to provide hosting services
for free software projects.  After working as a system administrator for 2
years (2002-2004) for TuxFamily, I became the president of the TuxFamily.org
organization in April 2004, and then retired in October 2004.

In March 2005, I came back and acted again as a system administrator, and
then as a member of the administration committee in 2006.

I quited the organization definitively in November 2006.

# Kernel Newbies

</span>

[Kernelnewbies](http://www.kernelnewbies.org) is a website aiming to give
help to people who wants to develop some things for the [Linux
kernel](http://www.kernel.org). I tried to help restoring the old Web site
of kernelnewbies.org some years ago.

# Linux En Rezo / SANS-Linux

<time>1999-2002</time>

<span class="project-logo">
![SANS Linux](/media/images/projects/sanslinux.png Kernelnewbies)
</span>

Linux En Rezo (literally "Linux on network") was a french website aiming to
give help to people who wanted to set up their own home-network. I wrote a
lot of documentation about installing services like DHCP, Samba, BIND,
Apache, etc... from 1999 to 2002. In 2001, Linux En Rezo became SANS-Linux
(System Administration and Network Security for Linux), but the project
finally died because I was no more able to continue, due to my work for
Debian and TuxFamily.

It seems that some documentations are still
[mirrored](http://cern91.tuxfamily.org/pub/Linux-en-rezo/).
