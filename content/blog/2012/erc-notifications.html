{% mark excerpt %}

Today, [I've merged my erc notifications
module](http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/trunk/revision/109176) inside
Emacs trunk. This way, it will be available for everybody in Emacs 24.2.

![erc-notifications example](/media/images/erc-notifications.png)

{% endmark %}

This module allows you to be notified via <code>notifications-notify</code>
(the Emacs implementation of the [Freedesktop desktop
notifications](http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/)) on
private message received on IRC, or when your nickname is mentioned on a
channel.

To enable it in Emacs > 24.1, you just have to add the following line to your configuration
file:

<pre code="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(add-to-list 'erc-modules 'notifications)
</pre>

If you want to download it and use it stand-alone for a previous Emacs
version, you can [fetch the latest file
revision](http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/trunk/annotate/head:/lisp/erc/erc-notifications.el)
and load it before adding the previously given line.
