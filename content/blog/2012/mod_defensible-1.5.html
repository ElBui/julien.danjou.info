{% mark excerpt %}

Apache 2.4 being out, I noticed that my good old
[mod_defensible](http://julien.danjou.info/software/mod_defensible) did not
compile anymore.

{% endmark %}

The changes in the Apache 2 API were small, so it was pretty easy to update
the software to make it compile. The only tricky change is the split of the
''remote_ip'' field of the connection structure to ''client_ip'' and
''peer_ip'', but it's succinctly documented into the Apache's changes file.

Honestly, I'm not sure that this module is really used into the wild, but I
still think that it can serves as a good prototype for doing other things so
I like keeping it around. Enjoy!
