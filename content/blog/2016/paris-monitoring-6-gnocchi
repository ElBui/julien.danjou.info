Last week was the sixth edition of the
[Paris Monitoring Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Monitoring/events/230515751/),
where I was invited as a speaker to present and talk about
[Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz).

There was around 50 persons in the room, listening to my presentation of
Gnocchi.

The talk went fine and I had a few interesting questions and feedback. One
interesting point that keeps coming when talking about Gnocchi, is its
OpenStack label, which scares away a lot of people. We definitely need to
continue explaining that the project work stand-alone has a no dependency on
OpenStack, just a great integration with it.

The
[slides are available online](https://julien.danjou.info/talks/gnocchi-paris-meetup-monitoring.pdf)
for those who are interested and may have not been present that day!

The [Monitoring-fr](http://www.monitoring-fr.org/) organization also
[interviewed me](http://www.monitoring-fr.org/2016/05/meetup-paris-monitoring-6-interview-de-julien-danjou-pour-gnocchi-metric-as-a-service/)
after the meetup about Gnocchi. The interview is in French, obviously. I talk
about Gnocchi, what it does, how it does it and why we started the project a
couple of years ago. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
