It's again that time of the year, where we all fly out to a different country
to chat about OpenStack and what we'll do during the next 6 months. This time,
it was in [Austin, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas) and we
chatted about the new Newton release that will be out in October.

As the _Project Team Leader_ for the Telemetry project, I set up and animated
the week for our team. We had 9 discussion slots of 40 minutes assigned, but
finally only used 8. We also, somehow, canceled the contributor team meet-up on
the last day, as only a few of us developers were there and available.

We took
[a few notes in our Etherpads](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Design_Summit/Newton/Etherpads#Telemetry),
but I think most of them were pretty sparse, as there was nothing really
important we talked about. Actually, many topics were already discussed and
covered 6 months ago in Tokyo during the previous summit. We just did not have
time to implement everything we wanted, so talking over it again would not have
been of a great help.

## Reference architecture

</div>

Unfortunately, nor Gordon Chung nor the
[OpenStack Innovation Center](https://osic.org/) had time to run the tests and
benchmarks they wanted to run before the summit. We still discussed their plan
to run tests and benchmark of the whole Telemetry suite (Ceilometer, Gnocchi &
Aodh). They should run their tests for 3 weeks, no more, in a few weeks. The
window to run tests being narrow, they want to be sure they are prepared, and
will reach to us for help, ideas, and validation.

I've also requested them to, if possible, provide us some profiling (e.g.
cProfile) data so we can have better knowledge of the area we can optimize.

## Gnocchi, next steps

</div>

This session was particularly smooth since most people in the room were not
up-to-date with Gnocchi 2.1. Some people expressed concerned about the InfluxDB
driver removal, though they were not aware of the bugs it had, and that Gnocchi
was actually performing better – so they may very likely be testing Gnocchi
directly instead.

No particular fancy feature was requested, only a few bugs and ideas noted on
Launchpad were discussed.

## Enhancing Ceilometer polling

This session was not particularly productive, as everything was we wanted to
discuss was already on the Etherpad from… Tokyo, 6 months ago. It turns out
nobody had time to pursue this project, so we'll see what happens. There's
definitely some work to do to pursue our goal of splitting the pipeline
definition into smaller files.

## Aodh roadmap & improvements

  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/bell-icon.png">
</div>

First, we decided to definitely kill the combination alarm in the future, in
favor of the new composite alarms definition that we like better.

We should switch to
[OpenStackClient](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-openstackclient/)
in the future for
[aodhclient](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-aodhclient/). The OSC
team indicated they are willing to provide a way to keep the "aodh" CLI command
on its own, which is something that blocked us to move to OSC.

A bunch of people indicated that had support for alarms CRUD in the Horizon
dashboard. They should work together with the Horizon team to complete what has
been started in Horizon recently to add Aodh support.

## Ceilometer splitting

<div class="illustration pull-right icon">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/fork_icon.png">
</div>

A year ago, we decided to split Ceilometer and its alarm feature: Aodh was
born. We did discuss doing it again 6 months ago, but nothing happened as we
already had so many stuff on our plate.

As far as I'm concerned, I think it's now time to split some Ceilometer
functionality again, so I'm going to do that this time with the event part.
Gordon found a name, and this new project will be named *Panko*.

## Documentation

<div class="illustration pull-right icon">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2016/icon-documentation.png">
</div>

We have then discussed our documentation. Users present in the room were
particularly happy with the Gnocchi policy that we apply since the beginning:
no doc = no merge of your patch. The consensus is to move forward on this
policy for all Telemetry projects, especially since it's now clear that the
documentation team is not going to help us more. Ildikó, our documentation
wizard, will take care of making some links between the official OpenStack
documentation and our projects, avoid content duplication.

For this cycle, my personal plan is to document Aodh up to roughly 80 %, and
then force that policy on newly implemented changes.

## Events management

The event management part of Ceilometer and API (soon to be split in its own
project as stated above) was discussed in this session. Nothing really exciting
coming here, as nobody is willing to enhance it for now. Which, again, makes it
a great candidate for splitting it out of Ceilometer.

## Vitrage

  <img src="/media/images/vitrage-logo.png">
</div>

The last session was dedicated to
[Vitrage](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vitrage), a root cause analysis tool
built on OpenStack. The Vitrage team had a few features that they wanted to see
in Aodh, so we discussed that at length. Notably, more support for sending
notifications on events (alarm creation, deletion…) should be added in this
next release.

Also, a new alarm type that would be entirely managed and triggered over HTTP
would be very useful for external projects such as Vitrage. We'll try to make
that happen during this cycle too.

## Talks

There were a few interesting talks about our telemetry projects during this
summit, among other I highly recommend watching:

* [OpenStack Ceilometer with Gnocchi and Aodh Feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5KT5GJKJw8),
  where Amol and Paul from Ericsson explain what Gnocchi and Aodh do and how
  they work, and then help people deploy it on their lab.
* [DPDK, Collectd & Ceilometer The Missing Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdebhsBFEJs),
  where Ryota Mibu, one of the contributor to Aodh explains why he implemented
  the event alarm feature
* [Showback & Chargeback!! OpenStack Gnocchi + Cloudkitty as a Whole Billing System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K8NI38LPtU),
  where Maximiliano Venesio (Nubeliu) and Stéphane Albert (Objectif Libre) talk
  about how they built an amazing scalable billing solution using
  [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz) and
  [CloudKitty](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CloudKitty)
* [Using Ceilometer Data for Effective Witch-Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q8pfbwxMb8),
  where Mike explain how Overstock.com leveraged Ceilometer to track anomalies
  in their cloud.

All of this should keep myself and the team busy for the next cycle. If you
have any question about what has been discussed or the future of our projects,
don't hesitate to leave a comment or ask us on the
[OpenStack development mailing list](http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev).
