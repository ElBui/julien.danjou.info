Last week-end, I was in Brussels, Belgium for the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org),
one of the greatest open source developer conference. I was not sure to go
there this year (I already skipped it in 2015), but it turned out I was
requested to do a talk in the shared
[Lua](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/lua/) &
[GNU Guile](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/gnu_guile/) devroom.

As a long time [Lua](http://lua.org) user and developer, and a follower of
[GNU Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) for several years, the
organizer asked me to run a talk that would be a link between the two
languages.

I've entitled my talk
"[How awesome ended up with Lua and not Guile](https://julien.danjou.info/talks/How_awesome_ended_with_Lua_and_not_Guile.pdf)"
and gave it to a room full of interested users of the awesome window manager ðŸ™‚.

We continued with a panel discussion entitled
"[The future of small languages Experience of Lua and Guile](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/future_guile_lua/)"
composed of Andy Wingo, Christopher Webber, Ludovic CourtÃ¨s, Etiene Dalcol,
Hisham Muhammaad and myself. It was a pretty interesting discussion, where both
language shared their views on the state of their languages.

It was a bit awkward to talk about Lua & Guile whereas most of my knowledge was
year old, but it turns out many things didn't change. I hope I was able to
provide interesting hindsight to both community. Finally, it was a pretty
interesting FOSDEM to me, and it was a long time I didn't give talk here, so I
really enjoyed it. See you next year!
