Exactly a year ago, I
[released the second edition of my book The Hacker's Guide to Python](/blog/2015/the-hacker-guide-to-python-second-edition).
One more time, it has been a wonderful release and I received a lot of amazing
feedback from my readers all over this year.

Since then, the book has been <strong>translated into 2 languages</strong>:
Korean and Chinese. A few thousands of copies has been distributed there, and
I'm very glad the book has been such a success. I'm looking into getting it
translated into more languages – don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you
have any interesting connections in your country.

For those who still don't know about this guide, that I first released a couple
of years ago, let me sum up by saying it's <strong>the Python book that I
always wanted to read</strong>, never found, and finally wrote. It does not
cover the basics of the language, but deals with concrete problems, best
practice and some of the languages internals.

It includes content about unit testing, methods, decorators, AST, distribution,
documentation, functional programming, scaling, Python 3, etc. All of that made
it pretty <strong>successful</strong>! It comes with awesome <strong>9
interviews</strong> that I realized with some of my fellow experienced Python
hackers and developers!

In that <strong>3rd edition</strong>, there is, like in each new edition, a few
fixes on code, typos, etc. I guess books need a lot of time to become perfect!
I also updated some of the content: things evolved a bit since I last revised
the content a year ago. Finally, a new chapter about timestamps handling and
timezone has made his appearance too.

If you didn't get the book yet, it's time to go
