Three years have passed since I started working
on [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz). It's amazing to gaze at the path we wandered
on.

During all this time, Gnocchi has been "incubated" inside OpenStack. It has
been created there and it grew with the rest of the ecosystem. But Gnocchi
(developers) always stuck to some strange principles: autonomy and independence
from the other OpenStack projects. This actually made the project a bit
unpopular sometimes inside OpenStack, being stamped as some kind of _rebel_.

I've spent the last years asserting that each project inside OpenStack should
seek towards living its own life. It is a key success for any open source
project to be able to be used in any context, not only the one it has been
built for. Having to use large bundles of projects together is not a good user
story. I wish OpenStack will be a set of more autonomous building blocks.

One of the most used project by people not using an entire OpenStack
installation has been [Swift](https://launchpad.net/swift). That was possible
because Swift always tried to be autonomous and to not depend on any other
service. It is able to leverage external services but it can also work without
any. And I feel that Swift is the most successful project if you measure that
success by being used by people having zero knowledge about OpenStack.

With the move toward the _Big Tent_, it struck me that the OpenStack Foundation
will end up as some sort of an Apache Foundation. And I am pretty sure nobody
forces you to use the [Apache HTTP server](https://httpd.apache.org/) if you
want to use e.g. [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org//)
or [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/).

Being part of OpenStack for Gnocchi has been a great advantage at the beginning
of the project. The infrastructure provided is awesome. The support we had from
the community was great. The Gerrit workflow suited us well.

But unfortunately, now that the project is getting more and more mature, many
of the requirements of being an OpenStack project has become a real burden. The
various processes forced by OpenStack is hurting the development pace. The
contribution workflow based around Gerrit
and [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) is too complicated for most external
contributors and therefore prevents new users to participate to the
development.
Worse, the bad image or reputation that OpenStack carries in certain situation
or communities is preventing Gnocchi to be evaluated and, maybe, used.

I think that many of those negative aspects are finally taken into account by
the OpenStack Technical Committee, as can be seen in
the
[proposed vision of 2 years from now for OpenStack](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/453262/).
Better late than never.

So after spending a lot of time weighing the pros and the cons, we, Gnocchi
contributors,
[finally decided to move Gnocchi out of OpenStack](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-March/114300.html).
We started to move the project to a brand
new [Gnocchi organization on GitHub](https://github.com/gnocchixyz). At the
time of this writing, only the main gnocchi repository is missing and should be
moved soon after the OpenStack Summit happening next week.

We also used that opportunity to make usage of the new Gnocchi logo, courtesy
of my friend Thierry Ung!

We'll see how everything will turn out and if the project will gain more
traction, as we hope. This will not change the consumption of Gnocchi made by
projects such as [Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer). and the project
aims to remain a good friend of OpenStack. ðŸ˜€
