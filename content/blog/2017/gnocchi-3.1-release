It's always difficult to know when to release, and we really wanted to do it
earlier. But it seems that each week more awesome work was being done
in [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz), so we kept delaying it while having no
pressure to push it out.

But now that the OpenStack cycle is finishing, even Gnocchi does not strictly
follow it, it seemed to be a good time to cut the leash and leave this release
be.

There are again some major new changes coming from 3.0. The previous version
3.0 was tagged in October and had 90 changes merged from 13 authors since 2.2.
This 3.1 version have 200 changes merged from 24 different authors. This is a
great improvement of our contributor base and our rate of change – even if our
delay to merge is very low. Once again, we pushed usage of release notes to
document user visible changes,
and [they can be read online](http://gnocchi.xyz/releasenotes/3.1.html).

Therefore, I am going to summary quickly the major changes:

* The REST API authentication mechanism has been modularized. It's now simple
  to provide any authentication mechanism for Gnocchi as a plugin. The default
  is now a HTTP basic authentication mechanism that does not implement any kind
  of enforcement.
  The [Keystone]((http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/))
  authentication is still available, obviously.

* Batching has been improved and can now create metrics on the fly, reducing
  the latency needed when pushing measures to non-existing metrics. This is
  leveraged by the [collectd-gnoccchi](https://github.com/jd/collectd-gnocchi)
  plugin for example.

* The performance of Carbonara based backend has been largely improved. This
  is not really listed as a change as it's not user-visible, but an amazing
  work of profiling and rewriting code from [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  to [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) has been done. While Pandas is very
  developer-friendly and generic, using NumPy directly offers way more
  performance and should decrease `gnocchi-metricd` CPU usage by a large
  factor.

* The storage has been split into two parts: the storage of incoming new
  measures to be processed, and the storage and archival of aggregated metrics.
  This allows to use e.g. file to store new measures being sent, and once
  processed store them into e.g. Ceph. Before that change, all the new measures
  had to go into Ceph. While there's no specific driver yet for incoming
  measures, it's easy to envision a driver for systems
  like [Redis](https://redis.io) or [Memcached](https://memcached.org).

* A new [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) driver has been merged. It
  works in the same way than the file
  or [OpenStack Swift](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/) drivers.

I will write more about some of these new features in the upcoming weeks, as
they are very interesting for Gnocchi's users.

We are planning to run a scalability test and benchmarks using
the [ScaleLab](http://scalelab.redhat.com/) in a few weeks if everything goes
as planned. I will obviously share the result here, but we also submitted a
talk for the
next
[OpenStack Summit in Boston](https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/) to
present the results of our scalability and performance tests – hoping the
session will be accepted.

I will also be talking about
Gnocchi
[this Sunday at FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/storing_metrics_gnocchi/).

We don't have a very determined roadmap for Gnocchi during the next weeks. Sure
we do have a few ideas on what we want to implement, but we are also very
easily influenced by the requests of our user: therefore feel free to ask for
anything!
