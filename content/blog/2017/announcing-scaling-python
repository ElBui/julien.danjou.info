My day-to-day activities are still evolving around
the [Python](http://python.org) programming language, as I continue working on
the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) project as part of my job
at [Red Hat](http://redhat.com). OpenStack is still the biggest Python project
out there, and attract a lot of Python hackers.

Those last few years, however, things have taken a different turn for me when I
made the choice with my team to rework the telemetry stack architecture. We
decided to make a point of making it scale way beyond what has been done in the
project so far.

I started to dig into a lot of different fields around Python. Topics you don't
often look at when writing a simple and straight-forward application. It turns
out that writing scalable applications in Python is not impossible, nor that
difficult. There are a few hiccups to avoid, and various tools that can help,
but it really is possible – without switching to another whole language,
framework, or exotic tool set.

Working on those projects seemed to me like a good opportunity to share with
the rest of the world what I learned. Therefore, I decided to share my most
recent knowledge addition around distributed and scalable Python application in
a new book,
entitled [The Hacker's Guide to Scaling Python](https://scaling-python.com) (or
_Scaling Python_, in short). The book should be released in a few months –
fingers crossed.

And as the book is still a work-in-progress, I'll be happy to hear any remark,
subject, interrogation or topic idea you might have or any particular angle you
would like me to take in this book (reply in
the [comments section](#disqus_thread) or shoot me
an [email](mailto:julien@danjou.info)). And if you'd like to get be kept
updated on this book advancement, you can subscribe in the following form or
from the [book homepage](https://scaling-python.com).

The adventure of working on my previous
book, [The Hacker's Guide to Python](https://thehackerguidetopython.com), has
been so tremendous and the feedback so great, that I'm looking forward
releasing this new book later this year!
