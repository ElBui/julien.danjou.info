Two years ago, I switched from my beloved *xmms* to
[audacious](http://audacious-media-player.org/).

During this 2 years with Audacious, I suffered a bit. It was working quite
fine, but I saw no big progress around it. Life happened, and I had to use a
network system to play music. I started to use PulseAudio over TCP, but it
does not work well, and does not work at all with Audacious (and even if the
plugin is provided by upstream). So I decided to dump it.

And some days ago I discovered [Sonata](http://www.musicpd.org/), a
[MPD](http://sonata.berlios.de/] client. I never liked MPD so far because
all clients I found were lame.

But I really like Sonata. It allows me to listen music the way I still want:
load everything in one playlist, listen everything randomly or type a
song/artist to jump to it directly in the current playlist. It even has some
nice feature (lyrics, so I'll be able to song out loud, covers, tag
editingâ€¦) and is written in Python and GTK+ (some days I may even hack it!).

You can rest in peace x11amp :-p
