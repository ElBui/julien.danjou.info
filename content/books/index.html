        The Hacker's Guide to Python
      </a>
    </h3>
    Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and
    more. It fast, flexible, and comes with batteries included.

    Most of the books you read about Python teach you the language basics.
    In this book, I want to show you how to leverage Python to efficiently
    tackle your problems and build great Python applications.
