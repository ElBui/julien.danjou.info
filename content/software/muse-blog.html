There's no tagged release for now.

# Manual
## Creating a blog project
You should load it from your Emacs start-up file:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'muse-blog)
</pre>

Then, you should define a project in `*muse-project-alist'*.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(add-to-list 'muse-project-alist
             '("MyBlog"
               ;; Path to your blog
               ("~/Blog")
               ;; Always re-publish index
               :force-publish ("index"))
              (:base "blog-xhtml"
                     :base-url "http://www.example.com/blog/"
                     :path "~/Blog/output/")
              (:base "blog-rss"
                     :base-url "http://www.example.com/blog/"
                     :path "~/Blog/output/"))
</pre>

This will add a new project named *MyBlog*, which have files in *~/Blog* and
will publish all files (XHTML and RSS) to *:path*. All URL will be relative to
*:base-url*.

## Writing entries
You're free to split your blog entries like you want: either all of them in
one Muse file, or a Muse file for each month, or even a file by entry.

The syntax for a blog entry is:

<pre class="prettyprint">
* 20100519-16:24:78 This is my first muse-blog entry

I'm very excited about all this. I think it's amazing to write a blog in
Emacs. Seriously. We should all thanks **jd** for his extraordinary work!
</pre>

An entry should start with a first-level heading, with the following format:

<pre class="prettyprint">
* YYMMDD-HH:MM:SS Title
</pre>

Date is mandatory, time and title are optional. If title is not specified,
the date will be used as a title.

## Building an index page
*muse-blog* provides you a way to create an index page and regroup all your
entries in a front page.

Just create a front page like this:

<pre class="prettyify">
#title This is my bloog!
#desc Blog of a new muse-blog user
<lisp>(muse-blog-make-index 0 9)</lisp>
----
Archives
<lisp>(muse-index-as-string t nil t)</lisp>
</pre>

This will create an index page (HTML and RSS) with the 10 first entries from
all files matching *`muse-blog-make-index-files-regexp'*.

You can even add a footer to add link from your archives. Footer is "----",
i.e. an horizontal line, and such a line is not included in an entry. *Muse*
provides a handy function to build page index, *`muse-index-as-string'*.
