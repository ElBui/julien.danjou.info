{% mark excerpt %}

The *google-weather* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) extension
allows to run access the Google Weather API from Emacs.

{% endmark %}

It includes **org-google-weather**, which can be used to add weather forecast in
your [Org](http://orgmode.org) agenda.

# Download

It is available from [the Git repository](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=google-weather-el.git;a=summary).

There's no tagged release for now.

# Manual
The easiest way to use it is to load it from your *.emacs*:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'google-weather)
</pre>

The function are documented, therefore you should not have any difficulty to
use them.

If you want to use **org-google-weather** to add weather forecasts in your
agenda, just add the following in your *.emacs.*

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'org-google-weather)
</pre>

Then, add the following in one of your Org file.

<pre class="prettyprint">
* Weather
%%(org-google-weather "New York")
</pre>

You can set the language as second argument. You should know that the unit
system used is language dependent. By default, American English is used,
therefore with Fahrenheit degrees, but if you want to have English with
Celsius degrees, you can use "en-gb".

<pre class="prettyprint">
* Weather
%%(org-google-weather "Paris 14" "en-gb")
</pre>
