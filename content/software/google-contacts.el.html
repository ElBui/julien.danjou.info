title: Google Contacts for Emacs
---
{% mark excerpt %}

The *google-contacts* for [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
extension allows to display your [Google
Contacts](http://google.com/contacts) directly inside Emacs.

{% endmark %}

**Note** that it is likely to only work with at least Emacs 24, since it's using
*oauth2* which is part of GNU ELPA.

# Download

It is available from [the Git
repository](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=google-contacts.el.git;a=summary).

There's no tagged release for now.

# Manual
The easiest way to use it is to load it from your *.emacs*:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'google-contacts)
</pre>

You can then use **M-x google-contacts** and type a query string.

Various key bindings are available. Here's a few:

 - **n** or **p** to go the next or previous record;
 - **g** to refresh the result, bypassing the cache;
 - **m** to send an e-mail to a contact;
 - **s** to make a new search;
 - **q** to quit.

You can integrate directly Google Contacts into [Gnus](http://gnus.org):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'google-contacts-gnus)
</pre>

Then you can use **;** to go to a contact information while reading an e-mail.

You can integrate directly Google Contacts into *message-mode*;

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lisp">
(require 'google-contacts-message)
</pre>

Then you can use **TAB** to go to complete e-mail addresses in the header
fields.
