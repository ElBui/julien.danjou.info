{% mark excerpt %}

*erc-track-score* is a module for [ERC](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC),
an IRC client for [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

{% endmark %}

It allows you to see a dynamic score on each tracked channel by the
*erc-track*.

The idea comes from the [ERC channel tracking proposed features
list](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcChannelTracking#toc10).

# Download

It is available from [the Git
repository](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=erc-track-score.git;a=summary).

There's no tagged release for now.

# Manual
You should enable *erc-track* first, and configure it to your needs.
You may also configure *erc-match* to have the score raised higher when some
keywords are matched.

*erc-track-score* works by modifying dynamically the number of *unread* messages
on channels. This is why you have to set *erc-track-showcount* to *t* to make
*erc-track-score* shows something.

On each message received in a channel, the score will be incremented by 1
point. When a text match occurs with *erc-match*, *erc-track-score* will add
score to the channel, based on the assoc list
*erc-track-channel-score-matched-text*.

By default, the scores added are:

 - +1 for any message;
 - +20 if the message has your current nick in it
 - +5 if the message has a keyword in it;
 - +2 if the message has been sent by a pal (see *erc-pals*);
 - -1 if the message has been sent by a dangerous-host (see
 *erc-dangerous-hosts*);
 - -1 if the message has been sent by a fool (see *erc-fools*).

The score will reach 0 by adding the value *erc-track-channel-score-reset-by*
(default is 1) every *erc-track-channel-score-reset-every (default is 10)*.

That means that by default a channel will always lost 6 points per minute,
until its score reaches 0.

On the other hand, if the score has been set negative because a lot of fools
talked, the channel will gain 6 points per minute, until its score reaches
0.

When using *erc-track-switch-buffer*, you can jump to the most scored channel
by setting *erc-track-switch-direction* to *mostactive*, since *erc-track-score*
modifies the number of unread message in *erc-modified-channels-alist*
directly.
