# Download
It is available from [GNU
ELPA](http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/elpa/files/head:/packages/rainbow-mode/).

You can install it from **M-x list-packages** in Emacs 24.

# Manual
Type *M-x rainbow-mode*. *Rbow* should be added to the mode-line, indicating
that Rainbow mode is in effect. You can deactivate it with the same command.

When activated, all strings representing colors will be highlighted with the
color they represent.

Some colors, like HTML colors name (yellow, red, â€¦) and rgb() ones are
automatically activated in some mode like *html-mode* or *css-mode*. On the
other hand, the X colors are activated only in some mode like
*emacs-lisp-mode* or *c-mode*.
The hexadecimal ones (#aabbcc) are always activated.

All this can be configured via M-x *customize-group rainbow*.
