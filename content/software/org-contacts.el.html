title: "Contacts for Org-mode"
---
{% mark excerpt %}

The **org-contacts** [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) extension
allows to manage your contacts using [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org).

{% endmark %}

It can be a replacement to [BBDB](http://bbdb.sourceforge.net) for people
using Org.

# Download
It is available in the contrib directory of [Orgmode](http://orgmode.org) (version > 7.5).

# Manual
## Basics
Just load the file from your .emacs:

<pre class="prettify lang-lisp">
(require 'org-contacts)
</pre>

There's a few variables you can customize. The main one is
*org-contacts-files* which determines which file(s) will be used to get your
contacts. If set to *nil*, all your Org agenda files will be used. If you set
it to a list of files, they will be used to look for contacts. Specifying
the list of files where contacts are rather than searching in all your Org
files will speed-up *org-contacts*.

What a contact is is determined by the matching rule in
*org-contacts-matcher*. By default, contacts are Org entry which have a **EMAIL**
property set.

<pre class="prettify">
#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Friends
** Dave Null
:PROPERTIES:
:EMAIL: dave@null.com
:END:
This is one of my friend.
*** TODO Call him for the party
</pre>

Now, if you do *M-x org-contacts* and search *Dave* you'll find Dave.

## Gnus integration
*Org-contacts* support [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org). You can use completion in *message-mode* in the To,
Cc, etc headers. You can also complete with tags. For example:

<pre class="prettify">
#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Friends
** Dave Null                               :dumb:
:PROPERTIES:
:EMAIL: dave@null.com
:END:
This is one of my friend.
** Slash Bin                             :school:
:PROPERTIES:
:EMAIL: slash@localhost.com
:END:
That good old Slash.
* Family
** Exam Pelle                              :dumb:
:PROPERTIES:
:EMAIL: exam@pelle.com
:END:
</pre>

If you type *+* in the **To** field and press *<TAB>* to complete, you'll get a
list of tags. Finishing the completion using a tag will expand the
completion to all the people having this tag. Therefore, typing *+dumb* and
pressing <TAB> will expand to *Dave Null \<dave@null.com>, Exam Pelle
\<exam@pelle.com>*.

When using Gnus, you'll also get a link to the last mail you read from your
contact. A link to the email will be placed in the
*org-contacts-last-read-mail-property* (default to *LAST_READ_MAIL*).

## Capture
To add new contact, you can use **org-capture**. Here is an entry example for
it:

<pre class="prettify lang-lisp">
(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
             '("c" "Contacts" entry (file "~/Org/contacts.org")
               "* %(org-contacts-template-name)
                  :PROPERTIES:
                  :EMAIL: %(org-contacts-template-email)
                  :END:"))
</pre>


The *org-contacts-template-name* and *org-contacts-template-email* functions
will try to determine the name and email of your new contact, using the mail
you are reading in Gnus, if possible.

## Anniversaries
*Org-contacts* handles anniversaries as well. The default is birthday. Just
press *C-c C-x p* to set a property and type *BIRTHDAY*. Chose date.

To see the birthday in your agenda, put such a line in one of you agenda
file:

<pre class="prettify">
#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Birthdays
%%(org-contacts-anniversaries)
</pre>
